--------------------

**Layouts folder:**  
- contains Triple's custom layouts. Copy these into GSTHD/Layouts folder

--------------------

**Resources folder:**  
- triple-oot-icons folder - custom icons either created by me or updated versions of what was in GSTHD/resources folder. Copy the entire folder and paste into GSTHD/resources folder.

- gsthd-icon-updates folder - cleaned up versions of gsthd's icons (tunics, shield, bombs, sticks, etc.). Addiontal icons added in case anyone wants to use them including dim/faded versions of starting progression icons. Pick and choose which icons you'd like or copy all the icons and paste directly over the icons in the GSTHD/resources folder. This folder is not necessary for any triple-oot layouts.

--------------------

**Hints folder:**  
- Various /season_#/sometimes_hint.json files, personal preference in labeling and naming.
- if you like, you can copy the one you need and overwrite the one in /gsthd folder is located

--------------------

**Screenshots folder:**  
- Visual screenshots of what each layout looks like. Only meant for reference.

--------------------

**Installation Instructions:**  
- [Download the latest release of Hapax's latest release of GSTHD](https://github.com/HapaxL/GSTHD/releases/latest)
- copy the whole /triple-oot-icons folder to wherever your GSTHD/resources folder is located
- copy triple-oot-WHICHEVERLAYOUT.json to wherever your GSTHD/layouts folder is located
- open gsthd's settings.json file change "ActiveLayout" name to your preferred layout.
example: "ActiveLayout": "triple-oot-standard-s6-bw"

--------------------

**Additional Settings.json changes:**  
These are additional settings I change in settings.json file. Meant as a suggestion only.
For additional information, please see GSTHDs documentation on all possible customization parameters.
- "DragButton": "Left",
- "AutocheckDragButton": "Right",
- "SongMarkerBehaviour": "DropAndCheck",

**Additional Notes:**  
- middle-click clears woth, barren and spawn fields
- mouse scroll wheel controls dungeon names and will increase / decrease item and number counts.
- Combined Tunics icon: left click controls goron tunic, right click controls zora tunic. Left click and hold will drag goron tunic icon. Right click and hold will drag zora tunic icon.
- Combined Boots icon: left click controls iron boots, right click controls hover boots. Left click and hold will drag iron boots icon. Right click and hold will drag hover boots icon.
- woth triforce icon: left click will go to the next boss icon. right click will go back to the previous boss icon. You can also drag and drop items / medallions / stones on the icon as well since it has the same properties as a Gossip Stone Icon.

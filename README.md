Layouts folder:
- contains Triple's custom layouts. Copy these into GSTHD/Layouts folder

--------------------

Resources folder:
- triple-oot-icons folder - custom icons either created by me or updated versions of what was in GSTHD/resources folder. Copy the entire folder and paste into GSTHD/resources folder.

- gsthd-icon-updates folder - cleaned up versions of gsthd's icons (tunics, shield, bombs, sticks, etc.). Addiontal icons added in case anyone wants to use them including dim/faded versions of starting progression icons. Pick and choose which icons you'd like or copy all the icons and paste directly over the icons in the GSTHD/resources folder. This folder is not necessary for any triple-oot layouts.

Screenshots folder:
- Visual screenshots of what each layout looks like. Only meant for reference.
